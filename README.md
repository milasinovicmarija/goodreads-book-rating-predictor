# Goodreads Book Rating Predictor

An ML model that predicts what my next rating of a book on Goodreads will be based on my previous ratings of books and their genres, lengths, average ratings, publication years and series.

This is an amateur project I have built that is designed to use my data from the goodreads account (anyone can put in their own file path and analyze their own) and predicts what my next rating will be based on my previous ratings, its genre, public average rating and number of pages (essentially everything available in the csv export)
